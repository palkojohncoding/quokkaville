            <h3>Mayor Quincy McQuokka</h3>
            <p class="mayor"><img id="mayor" src="mayor_quincy.png">Mayor Quincy McQuokka has called Quokkaville home since the day he popped out of his pouch, and for the past seven years he’s proudly worn the mayor’s sash (sometimes right over his burgundy jacket). Everything Quincy loves seems to come in shades of burgundy—his house, his wardrobe, even his board game of choice, The Castles of Burgundy. Spot him strolling through town and you’ll know it’s him by the grin, the jacket, and maybe a faint whiff of victory from last night’s board-game marathon.</p>

            <h3>Patricia "Peddles" Peddlington</h3>
            <p class="peddles"><img id="peddles" src="peddles.png">Patricia “Peddles” Peddlington is the unstoppable whirlwind of Quokkaville’s cycling scene. With a grin as bright as her bike’s chrome and legs that could outspin a tailwind, she tears through the “Tour de Quokkaville” every year. When she’s not racing, you’ll find her at Peddles’ Bike Shop and Repairs, covered in grease and laughter, tuning up bikes and spirits alike. She swears every bolt has a personality, and every chain hums a story. Folks say you can hear her humming down Main Street long before you see the blur of purple and joy that is Peddles herself.</p>
