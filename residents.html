            <h3>Mayor Quincy McQuokka</h3>
            <p class="mayor-quincy"><img class="resident-bios-image" id="mayor" src="mayor_quincy.png" loading="lazy">Mayor Quincy McQuokka has called Quokkaville home since the day he popped out of his pouch, and for the past seven years he’s proudly worn the mayor’s sash (sometimes right over his burgundy jacket). Everything Quincy loves seems to come in shades of burgundy—his house, his wardrobe, even his board game of choice, The Castles of Burgundy. Spot him strolling through town and you’ll know it’s him by the grin, the jacket, and maybe a faint whiff of victory from last night’s board-game marathon.</p>

            <h3>Sasha McQuokka</h3>
            <p class="sasha-mcquokka"><img class="resident-bios-image" id="sasha-mcquokka" src="sasha_mcquokka.png" loading="lazy">Sasha McQuokka is the cheerful six-year-old daughter of Mayor Quincy McQuokka. Every morning, she slips into her favourite pink sparkly dress and heads out to her garden, where rows of daisies and tulips wait for her gentle watering can. She hums while she works, sprinkling each petal like she’s sharing a secret. The townsfolk of Quokkaville often see her skipping down the lane, glitter catching in the sunlight, leaving tiny spark trails behind her. Though she’s small, Sasha’s kindness is well known—flowers seem to bloom brighter under her care, and her laughter makes the whole town feel lighter.</p>

            <p class="rosie-mcquokka"><img class="resident-bios-image" id="rosie-mcquokka" src="rosie_mcquokka.png" loading="lazy">Meet Rosie McQuokka, the cheerful four-year-old daughter of Quokkaville’s mayor! Rosie never leaves home without her favorite sparkly red dress—it twirls just right when she skips down the forest paths. Every afternoon, she rounds up her friends for a grand adventure among the gum trees, laughing as they spot butterflies and race the breeze. Her secret to keeping everyone happy? Snacks—always snacks. From crunchy crackers to sweet berry bites, Rosie’s little orange bag is a treasure chest of treats. With a giggle and a wink, she says, “A good explorer never walks hungry!” And everyone happily agrees.</p>

Every morning, he slips on his favourite blue tee, black shorts, and trusty Crocs before settling into his cozy desk, coffee steaming beside him. Lines of colourful code dance across his monitors as he builds websites for local shops, updates the mayor’s gaming webpage, and keeps the town’s official website running. Outside his window, Quokkaville hums with life — bicycles whizzing by, kookaburras calling from the trees. Webby just grins and keeps typing. After all, in Quokkaville, good code means good vibes. </p>

With his long legs and easy grin, Gannigan’s known for introducing himself as “one-third of tall, dark, and handsome,” a line that earns both eye-rolls and laughs. When he’s not writing or swimming, he’s the go-to quokka for reaching anything on the top shelf. Gannegan insists that’s his real journalistic edge — the higher the view, the better the story.</p>
