            <p><b>A Letter from the Mayor of Quokkaville</b></p>
            <p>It brings me great joy to welcome you to the brand-new Quokkaville website — our digital home and a window into the heart of our smiling town. This project has been in the works for some time, and I couldn’t be prouder to finally share it with you.</p>
            <p>Here, you’ll find the latest news and cheerful updates from <i>The Daily Smile</i>, our town’s own newspaper dedicated to celebrating the everyday magic of Quokkaville. You can also look forward to <i>Smiles Monthly</i>, a newsletter that shines a light on local stories, upcoming events, and the friendly faces who make our community so special.</p>
            <p>And don’t miss the <i>We Are The Residents</i> section — a growing collection of personal biographies that remind us who we are when we stand together: curious, kind, and forever optimistic.</p>
            <p>This website is more than pixels and pages; it’s a reflection of our shared spirit. May it connect us more deeply, inspire us to keep smiling, and remind us that every good story begins right here at home.</p>
            <br>
