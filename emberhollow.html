      <h2>Deep in Emberhollow Valley</h2>
      <p>Deep in the smoking hills of Emberhollow Valley, where the air shimmered like warm honey and dragon snores rattled the cliffs, there lived a tribe of quokkas who really should not have been there.</p>
      <p>The <em>Emberhollow Quokkas</em> were small, fuzzy, and cheerfully delusional. They’d settled right in the middle of Dragon Territory, declaring it “cozy” and “excellent for picnics.”</p>
      <p>Their leader was Granny Quokka, who claimed she once knitted socks for a dragon’s tail. Their cook was Nibble, who added chili peppers to <em>everything</em> (“for bravery,” she said). And then there was Pip McQuokka—small, scruffy, and curious enough to be dangerous.</p>
      <p>Pip was famous for two things: his grin and his terrible ideas.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1 - The Great Cheese Plan</h2>
      <p>One bright, smoky morning, Pip stared up at the biggest dragon cave in the valley. It belonged to <em>Magnor the Mighty</em>, a colossal red dragon whose snore could melt butter.</p>
      <p>“Inside that cave,” whispered Pip, “is the world’s largest piece of dragon cheese.”</p>
      <p>“Cheese?” said Nibble. “Dragons don’t make cheese.”</p>
      <p>Pip grinned. “Then what’s that smell?”</p>
      <p>(It was sulfur. It was always sulfur.)</p>
      <p>Still, by sunset, Pip had talked half the tribe into joining him on an expedition. They armed themselves with sticks, lanterns, and a heroic song Granny made up on the spot that rhymed <em>lava</em> with <em>guava</em>.</p>
      <p>They tiptoed into the cavern. The ground rumbled. Pip whispered, “Quiet, everyone. Dragons can hear a crumb fall.”</p>
      <p>At which point Nibble sneezed so loudly that Magnor himself stirred.</p>
      <p>A golden eye opened. Smoke curled from his nostrils. “Who,” he growled, “is singing about <em>guava</em> in my cave?”</p>
      <p>Pip stepped forward, tail trembling but grin unshaken. “Good evening, your fiery greatness! We, uh, were just looking for some… cheese?”</p>
      <p>Magnor blinked. “Cheese?”</p>
      <p>“Yes!” Pip said brightly. “We thought dragons might have some.”</p>
      <p>Magnor frowned, then chuckled—a sound like an earthquake yawning. “You’re either brave or very silly.”</p>
      <p>Pip thought about that. “Why not both?”</p>
      <p>The dragon laughed so hard that bits of ash fell from the ceiling. Then he waved his claws. “Take this and go before I sneeze flames.”</p>
      <p>He handed Pip a chunk of glowing amberstone, still warm from his hoard.</p>
      <p>“Wow,” whispered Granny later, “you brought back treasure!”</p>
      <p>Pip puffed up. “Told you there was something valuable in there.”</p>
      <p>(He didn’t mention that his tail was still smoking.)</p>

      <h2> Chapter 2 - Fire Lessons</h2>
      <p>After that, Pip decided he wanted to <em>learn</em> from the dragons.</p>
      <p>He followed Magnor around, asking questions like: “How do you burp fire without burning your tongue?” “Do you polish your scales, or do they just sparkle?” “Do dragons dream about marshmallows?”</p>
      <p>Magnor, to everyone’s surprise, didn’t eat him. He even started calling Pip “Little Spark.”</p>
      <p>One day, Magnor said, “If you’re so eager, perhaps I can teach you a little dragon trick.”</p>
      <p>Pip’s eyes went wide. “You mean… breathing fire?”</p>
      <p>Magnor smirked. “Something like that.”</p>
      <p>He taught Pip how to puff his cheeks, hold his breath, and exhale through his whiskers while thinking <em>hot thoughts.</em> Pip tried and produced nothing but a sneeze and a puff of dust.</p>
      <p>“Again,” said Magnor.</p>
      <p>So Pip tried all day, until he coughed and—<strong>poof!</strong>—a tiny blue flame sparked from his fur.</p>
      <p>He yelped and dunked himself in the nearest puddle.</p>
      <p>The tribe cheered anyway. “Our first fire-quokka!” they cried.</p>
      <p>Pip grinned, damp but proud. “Maybe next I’ll roast marshmallows without sticks!”</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3 - The Cloudfire Festival</h2>
      <p>Every year, the dragons of Emberhollow threw a grand festival called <em>Cloudfire</em>, where they painted the sky with fire breath and molten trails. The quokkas were supposed to hide during it—small furballs and fireworks didn’t mix well.</p>
      <p>But this year, Pip had a plan.</p>
      <p>“What if we <em>join</em> the dragons?” he said. “Show them quokkas can sparkle too!”</p>
      <p>The others stared. “Sparkle how?”</p>
      <p>“Glowsticks,” said Pip. “And maybe a dance.”</p>
      <p>So they prepared. The quokkas collected bits of shiny dragon scales, polished them till they gleamed, and tied them to their tails. Granny stitched glowberries into their clothes.</p>
      <p>When Cloudfire night came, the sky roared alive with flame. The quokkas marched out, glowing and jingling.</p>
      <p>“Presenting,” shouted Pip, “the Emberhollow Quokka Dance Troupe!”</p>
      <p>The dragons froze mid-roar, blinking down at the tiny sparkling creatures. Then Magnor chuckled. “Well, let’s see this dance, Little Spark.”</p>
      <p>Pip gulped, then started hopping. One-two-hop, tail-twirl, spin! The others joined in, laughing, glowing brighter with each bounce.</p>
      <p>The dragons began to <em>rumble</em>—not with anger, but with laughter. Their deep booming chuckles echoed through the valley. One even clapped (which caused a small earthquake).</p>
      <p>By the end, Pip and the quokkas were declared <em>official Cloudfire guests</em>. Magnor gave them a golden acorn “for bravery in the face of very hot things.”</p>

      <h2>Chapter 4 - Trouble from the North</h2>
      <p>Peace didn’t last long.</p>
      <p>One morning, a cold wind blew down from the Frostpeaks. The dragons stopped smiling. Their fires sputtered.</p>
      <p>“Frostwyrms,” said Magnor grimly. “Ice dragons. They’re moving south.”</p>
      <p>The quokkas huddled. “Do they, um… eat fuzzy things?”</p>
      <p>“Only if we can’t drive them back,” said Magnor.</p>
      <p>So the dragons prepared for battle—claws sharpened, wings spread, flames roaring. The quokkas, meanwhile, made snacks. (“Heroes need sandwiches,” said Nibble.)</p>
      <p>But Pip had another idea. “We’re too small to fight, but maybe we can <em>help</em>.”</p>
      <p>He scampered up the cliffs with his little bag of glowberries and amberstone.</p>
      <p>When the Frostwyrms arrived—huge, glacial creatures with eyes like icicles—the air turned white with snow.</p>
      <p>Magnor and his dragons breathed fire, but the Frostwyrms’ cold breath turned it to steam.</p>
      <p>That’s when Pip leapt from a ledge, holding up his glowing amberstone. “Hey frosty-face!” he shouted. “Bet you can’t catch me!”</p>
      <p>The Frostwyrm blinked. “What <em>is</em> that fuzzy spark?”</p>
      <p>Pip waved his glowing stone. The light reflected in the Frostwyrm’s eyes, dazzling him.</p>
      <p>“Over here!” Pip yelled, hopping from rock to rock. The Frostwyrm chased, slipping on melting snow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Magnor and the others regained their strength and blasted a ring of fire around the valley. The Frostwyrms, hissing, retreated north, their icy tails between their legs.</p>
      <p>When it was over, Pip was found half-buried in a snowdrift, smiling sleepily. “Did we win?”</p>
      <p>Granny laughed. “You distracted a dragon with your nonsense, dear. Of course we did.”</p>
      <p>Magnor lifted Pip gently in one claw. “Little Spark,” he said, “you might be the bravest creature I’ve ever met—and the smallest fool.”</p>
      <p>“Thanks,” said Pip. “I try.”</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5 - The Dragon Promise</h2>
      <p>After the Frostwyrms fled, Emberhollow was brighter than ever.</p>
      <p>Magnor held a feast that lasted three days. The dragons roasted mountains of food, and the quokkas built ladders just to reach the tables. Pip was given a tiny helmet made from a thimble and named <em>Honorary Firekeeper of Emberhollow.</em></p>
      <p>“Does that mean I get to breathe fire?” Pip asked.</p>
      <p>Magnor smiled. “It means you already do—just in your heart.”</p>
      <p>Pip pretended to think. “Can I still try breathing real fire?”</p>
      <p>Magnor sighed. “Perhaps later.”</p>
      <p>That night, under a sky glittering with dragonfire and quokka laughter, Pip stood on a rock and looked out over the valley.</p>
      <p>The dragons slept peacefully again. The quokkas sang songs about cheese, bravery, and how not to sneeze near lava.</p>
      <p>Pip grinned, tail twitching. “What do you think, Granny?” he said. “Not bad for a bunch of fuzzy things in Dragon Country.”</p>
      <p>Granny smiled. “Not bad at all, Little Spark. But don’t you go thinking you’ve run out of adventures.”</p>
      <p>Pip’s eyes gleamed. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p>
      <p>And somewhere high above, Magnor’s deep chuckle rolled across the sky—warm as firelight, soft as smoke, and full of promise.</p>

      <h2>Epilogue: The Legend of the Fire Quokka</h2>
      <p>Years later, the dragons still told stories of the tiny creature who glowed like a spark and laughed in the face of frost.</p>
      <p>“Careful,” they’d say to their young. “If you see a flicker of light in the valley at night—it might not be a flame. It might be Pip McQuokka, coming to borrow your cheese.”</p>
      <p>And in the little burrows below, the quokkas would giggle, raise their glowberries high, and whisper, “Long live the Fire Quokka!”</p>
      <p>Then they’d dance—hop, twirl, spin—under the smoky stars of Emberhollow.</p>
