            <p class="description">Webby’s Wisdom is a cozy corner of Quokkaville’s website where curious minds learn about coding. Each post breaks down web design concepts in simple, friendly ways—then shows how those same tricks and techniques are used right here on the site. It’s fun, clever, and always a little bit quokka-curious. Whenever we use web design jargon, like <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> or <span id="purple-text">:nth-of-type()</span>, we'll write it in <span id="purple-text"><b>PURPLE</b></span> so it's easy to spot!</p>

            <p><b>How the "n-th-of-type" Rule Makes Quokkaville Look Great!</b></p>
            <p>Hey there, bright-eyed coders! Have you ever visited our <i>We Are The Residents</i> page and noticed how some quokka pictures float to the left while others float to the right? That’s not magic — it’s <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> using a clever trick called <span id="purple-text">:nth-of-type()</span>!</p>
            <p>Here’s how it works: imagine you have a bunch of paragraphs (<span id="purple-text">&lt;p&gt;</span>) on your page, each with a photo inside. <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> can count them — 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on — and give each group its own style.</p>
            <p>The code tells the even-numbered bios to float their images to the left, and the odd ones to the right. The result? A nice zigzag layout that’s fun to read and easy on the eyes!</p>
            <p>It’s like a dance of images — left, right, left, right — across Quokkaville’s smiling faces. Try it on your own page and see how your stories come alive with rhythm and balance. Even the mayor says it’s picture-perfect!</p>
