            <h1>Webby's Wisdom</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>A cozy corner of Quokkaville’s website where curious minds learn about coding. Each post breaks down web design concepts in simple, friendly ways—then shows how those same tricks and techniques are used right here on the site. It’s fun, clever, and always a little bit quokka-curious. Whenever we use web design jargon, like <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> or <span id="purple-text">:nth-of-type()</span>, we'll write it in <span id="purple-text"><b>PURPLE</b></span> so it's easy to spot!</p>

            <p><b>How the "n-th-of-type" Rule Makes Quokkaville Look Great!</b></p>
            <p>Hey there, bright-eyed coders! Have you ever visited our <i>We Are The Residents</i> page and noticed how some quokka pictures float to the left while others float to the right? That’s not magic — it’s <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> using a clever trick called <span id="purple-text">:nth-of-type()</span>!</p>
            <p>Here’s how it works: imagine you have a bunch of paragraphs (<span id="purple-text">&lt;p&gt;</span>) on your page, each with a photo inside. <span id="purple-text">CSS</span> can count them — 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on — and give each group its own style.</p>
            <p>The code tells the even-numbered bios to float their images to the left, and the odd ones to the right. The result? A nice zigzag layout that’s fun to read and easy on the eyes!</p>
            <p>It’s like a dance of images — left, right, left, right — across Quokkaville’s smiling faces. Try it on your own page and see how your stories come alive with rhythm and balance. Even the mayor says it’s picture-perfect!</p>

            <p><b>CSS: Making Websites Look Awesome!</b></p>
            <p>Have you ever seen a website with bright colors, fun fonts, or pictures in the perfect spot? That’s all thanks to <span id="purple-text">CSS</span>—the magic that makes websites look cool! CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, but don’t worry, it’s easier than it sounds.</p>
            <p>Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. CSS is like the clothes, paint, and decorations that make it stylish. With CSS, you can change colors, make text bigger or smaller, move pictures to the left or right, and even add fun animations!</p>
            <p>You use selectors to tell the computer what to style. For example, <span id="purple-text">p { color: blue; }</span> turns all paragraphs blue, and <span  id="purple-text">h1 { font-size: 50px; }</span> makes headings huge!</p>
            <p>CSS is like being a web designer—you get to make your page look exactly how you imagine. Grab some code, get creative, and watch your webpage shine!</p>

            <p><b>HTML: The Magic Behind Webpages!</b></p>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how websites show pictures, words, and buttons? That’s all thanks to <span id="purple-text">HTML</span>—it’s like the building blocks of the internet! HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, but don’t let that scare you. Think of it as a giant LEGO set for web pages.</p>
            <p>With HTML, you can tell the computer: “Hey! Make this a heading!” or “Put this picture here!” You do this using tags, which are special words inside <span id="purple-text">&lt; &gt;</span> symbols. For example, <span id="purple-text">&lt;p&gt;</span> starts a paragraph and <span  id="purple-text">&lt;h1&gt;</span> makes a big heading. You can even add links, images, lists, and more!</p>
            <p>HTML is super fun because it lets you create your own mini webpages. You can make a page about your favorite animals, hobbies, or even your dream city. It’s like painting—but with code!</p>
            <p>So grab your keyboard, start typing, and let HTML help you build your own online world!</p>
