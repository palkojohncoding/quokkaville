            <p><b>Gannegan “Gangly” Longtail Joins <i>The Daily Smile</i></b></p>
            <p class="purple date">By Nina Newshound, Editor-in-Chief</p>
            <p><i>The Daily Smile</i> is beaming a little brighter this week with the arrival of its newest reporter, Gannegan “Gangly” Longtail. Known around Quokkaville for his quick wit and boundless curiosity, Gangly brings an energetic spark to the newsroom. With his trademark crooked grin and knack for finding stories in the most unexpected corners, he’s already turning heads — and filling notebooks. Editor-in-Chief Nina Newshound praised Gangly’s “keen nose for a headline and heart for the truth.” Gangly himself says he’s thrilled to join the Smile, especially alongside his cousin Finnegan Longtail. “Between the two of us,” he joked, “there won’t be a single untold story left in Quokkaville — or an unguarded cookie jar.” Readers can look forward to Gangly’s first feature in next week’s edition. If his enthusiasm is any clue, it’s bound to make us all smile a little wider.</p>
