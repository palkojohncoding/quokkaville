            <p><b>Mystery of the Flying Leaves: A November Adventure</b></p>
            <p class="purple date">By Finnegan Longtail, Reporter</p>
            <p>Something magical is happening in Quokkaville this November! Each afternoon, just as the sun begins to set, colorful leaves start swirling and twirling through the streets—forming perfect little spirals before drifting away again. Curious quokkas everywhere have been wondering: what’s making the leaves dance?</p>
            <p>Mayor McQuokka sent out his best detectives—Rosie and Sasha—to solve the mystery. Armed with magnifying glasses and giggles, the two followed the trails of golden leaves through the park and down Maple Lane. After much searching (and a few snack breaks), they discovered the culprits: a family of playful forest breezes sneaking in for fun!</p>
            <p>Instead of stopping them, the mayor declared a new Quokkaville tradition—The Great Leaf Dance—where everyone joins the breezes for an afternoon of swirling, twirling joy.</p>
            <p>Now, every November day ends with laughter, flying leaves, and a touch of Quokkaville magic!</p>

            <p>The town of Quokkaville was buzzing with excitement this weekend as Mayor McQuokka officially opened the brand-new Green Leaf Park! With a shiny red ribbon stretched across the entrance, the mayor—looking dapper in his top hat and bow tie—snipped it in one grand “snap,” marking the park officially open for fun.</p>
            <p>Families cheered, and kids dashed straight to the playground, where swings swooshed, slides sparkled, and laughter filled the air. Rosie and Sasha McQuokka joined the fun too, sharing snacks and helping other little quokkas plant flowers in the community garden.</p>
            <p>The park features shady trees, picnic tables, and winding walking paths perfect for afternoon strolls. Mayor McQuokka called it “a place for everyone to smile, play, and grow together.”</p>
            <p>With sunshine, laughter, and a ribbon snip heard ’round town, Green Leaf Park opened in true Quokkaville style—joyfully and with a grin!</p>
