            <p>Quokkaville Buzz: A Spooky Success!</p>
            <p class="purple date">By Finnegan Longtail, Reporter</p>
            <p>Quokkaville came alive last night with giggles, squeals, and the rustle of candy bags as children of all ages went door-to-door for Halloween! Streets were lined with spooky decorations, jack-o’-lanterns flickering, and the air filled with the sweet scent of treats.</p>
            <p>Adding an extra dose of charm to the festivities, Mayor McQuokka joined in the fun, accompanied by his daughters Sasha and Rosie. The trio made quite the impression, with the mayor dressed as a friendly wizard and the girls twirling in glittery costumes, delighting everyone they met.</p>
            <p>From haunted houses to glowing pumpkins, every corner of town was a scene straight from a storybook. Local families say it was the best Halloween in years, and the mayor promised next year would be even bigger. One thing’s for sure—Quokkaville knows how to trick, treat, and sparkle!</p>
